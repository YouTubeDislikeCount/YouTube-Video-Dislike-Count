# YouTube Video Dislike Count
In November 2021, YouTube decided to make the dislike count for videos private. This extension makes it possible to see the dislike count even though YouTube removed it.

This extension is safe to install, and you can confirm that by checking the source code at **<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/youtubedislikecount/YouTube-Video-Dislike-Count/tree/main/Extension">https://github.com/youtubedislikecount/YouTube-Video-Dislike-Count/tree/main/Extension</a>**.

## Update
As of 2021/12/13, this project is no longer maintained.

1. Download and install the extension from **<a href="https://youtubedislikecount.github.io/" target="_blank">https://youtubedislikecount.github.io/</a>**.
